    Execute "docker-compose up -d --scale bot=<number>" in the main directory.
    This will start the <number> of bots and the client containers in detached
    mode.

    To start the application you can run "python3 bot-cli.py" to start a command
    line interface or run "python3 bot-slack.py" to start the app connected to 
    Slack.

    Note: If your docker machine ip is not 192.168.99.100 add your machine IP to 
    the commands: "python3 bot-cli.py <yourIP>". You can check your docker machin 
    IP with "docker-machine ip".

    Commands:

    	* list: diplays a list with the avaliable bots to talk to.

    	* start_session <bot_name>: starts a conversation with <bot_name>.

    	* end_session: end the current conversation.

    ***** It's important to name the main directory "chat" as --scale attaches
    ***** this name to the beginning of the container names.
